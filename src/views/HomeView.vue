    if you believe any of the following services would be useful to your business&hellip;</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-3">Event Tickets</h3>
    <p>Provide secure tickets for your events.</p>
    <p>These tickets are non-transferable and impossible to fake.
      Unlike digital images and tickets, they are impossible to duplicate. Particularly
      useful for VIPs or organising exclusive private events.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-3">Mementos</h3>
    <p>Once an event is over, you can gift those who took the time to attend
      with a &rsquo;memento&lsquo;.
    </p>
    <p>Again, these are non-transferable and impossible to duplicate.
      Ideal if you want to reward those same people at some point in the future or invite 
      only those who attended an event to subsequent events.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-3">Loyalty system</h3>
    <p>Loyalty schemes are expensive and exposes your brand to fraud (the damage to
      reputation could be catastrophic). But rewarding loyal customers is an essential
      part of maintaining that relationship and keeping them coming back.
    </p>
    <p>Loyalty points are awarded with your own &rsquo;cryptocurrency&lsquo;
      and are impossible to duplicate or fake.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-3">Proof of ownership</h3>
    <p>Combat fake garments which ruin your reputation and allow others to profiteer from your brand.
      With each item sold (or alternatively, each <em>high-value</em> good sold) the owner will receive
      a secure digital certificate of authenticity. When re-selling the item on Vestiaire etc., they can
      provide cryptographic proof of ownership without needing to send the item to an &rsquo;authority&lsquo;
      for checking <em>and</em> they can transfer the certificate to the new owner.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-3">A.I. for everyone</h3>
    <p>Apply A.I. to your brand without needing to be a data science boffin.
      Our A.I. services make use of industry's best Deep Learning algorithms, wrapped
      in a simple to use and intuitive user interface. You can quickly identify
      new target audiences, which instagram followers to target (based on their likes and preferences),
      and help scale your brand much faster than natural organic growth or aimless social media advertising.
    </p>
    <p>A.I. helps you become more strategic and reach the people who <em>want to buy your products</em>!</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-3">Voting system</h3>
    <p>Gaining business insight from your customers is the new standard.
      It allows you to anticipate what your next move should be without needing a time machine.
      Much of Haute Tech's service suite is dedicated to helping upcoming talent and established
      fashion houses understand their customer-base and make informed, strategic decisions.
    </p>
    <p>The first iteration of this is a voting system to gather feedback from carefully
      selected customers. Allow them to feel they are a part of the design process and
      helping shape the brands they love - it will work wonders for loyalty and can easily
      be incorporated into your loyalty scheme (discussed above).
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-3">Renting goods</h3>
    <p>Use our rental system is based on a new Blockchain standard <strong>ERC-4907</strong>.
      In laymen's terms, this means it's un-hackable and fully traceable. providing you with
      everything you need to run a rental service without all of the headaches associated from
      traditional software systems.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-3">Secure website hosting</h3>
    <p>This one is difficult to describe without getting technical, so we'll just
      say we can provide secure web hosting services which scale no matter how many
      people are trying to access your site because your site is running on thousands of web servers all over the world.
      These sites <em>cannot be modified</em> by hackers and are backed by the <a href="https://filecoin.io" target="_blank">Filecoin network</a> -
      a decentralised storage network which is immune to traditional attacks like distributed denial of service (DDoS).
